          Through my journey as a professional modern dancer and yoga/fitness instructor I found an interest in learning to code.
          Finally, I decided it was time I stop thinking about it and start learning. While performing professionally
          for <b><a href="https://www.artichokedance.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Artichoke Dance Company</a></b>,
          a company member I danced with was a full time Software Engineer while dancing professionally part time. Once I started to teach
          myself to code I would often ask him questions on what I had just learned. I thought it was so great to be asking coding advice
          from a fellow dancer, I never would have thought! Also, through my career in yoga and fitness with <b><a href="https://www.corepoweryoga.com/"
          target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Corepower Yoga</a></b> and <b><a href="https://www.janedo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
          Jane DO</a></b> I have had the pleasure of connecting with so many awesome professionals in the tech industry I knew coding was the perfect next
          step for me. Shortly after I began my coding journey, my husband and I moved to San Francisco from NYC due to a new job opportunity.
          While in San Francisco, I found <b><a href="https://www.rithmschool.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rithm School</a></b>
          coding bootcamp and after doing my research I knew I had to interview. I am now a graduate of Rithm school and ready to start my new journey in
          the tech industry! My journey to becoming a Software Engineer has definitely been a non-traditional one, but I wouldn't
          change it. It has made me the engineer and person I am today. I am passionate about coding as well as physical and mental health,
          if you share any of my passions, or just want to chat, please reach out to me through my contact page, I'd love to hear from you!
